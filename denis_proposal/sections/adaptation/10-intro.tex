%CUT by comment Our past work establishes that experts, Chapters~\ref{ch:contracat} and \ref{ch:expert} can solve tasks not possible by generalists, Chapters ~\ref{ch:unspecialized} and \ref{ch:hybrid}.
%
%Additionally, the work independently creates datasets for machine translation, Background Section~\ref{sec:mt} and question answering, Background Section~\ref{sec:qa}. 

We propose a new task where the gold standard is subjective and all-important, thereby requiring authoritative experts.  
%
Machine translation usually translates words literally; however, this does not necessarily apply in a cultural context.  
%
Certain named entities may be relevant in one culture but not another.  
%
One can find applicable named entity modulations by referencing WikiData, a human-interpretable and human-verified representation of Wikipedia.
%
We will want to investigate if this method generates better candidates than an embedding-based approach, such as word2vec.  
%
And a genuine evaluation of this approach requires specialized users, specifically German nationals that would understand the language and culture.
