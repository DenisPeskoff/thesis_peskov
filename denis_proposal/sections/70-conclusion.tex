\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

In this proposal, we have covered past work that creates datasets using three types of data pools: unspecialized, hybrid, and expert.  
%
We argue that improving data quality with reliable data generators and annotators is paramount towards establishing new \nlp{} tasks.
%
We propose a new task, cultural adaptation, that both passively evaluates a crowd-sourced data source, WikiData, while using verified cultural experts to create the gold standard.
