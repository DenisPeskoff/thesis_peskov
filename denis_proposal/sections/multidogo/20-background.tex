\section{Existing Dialogue Datasets}


There are multiple existing goal-oriented dialogue collections generated by humans through Wizard-of-Oz techniques.  The Dialog State Tracking Challenge, \textit{aka} Dialog Systems Technology Challenge, (\textsc{dstc}) spans 8 iterations and entails the domains of bus timetables, restaurant reservations, and hotel bookings, travel, alarms, movies, etc. \citep{williams2016dialog}.  Frames \citep{asri2017frames} has 1369 dialogues about vacation packages.  \multiwoz contains 10,438 dialogues about Cambridge hotels and restaurants \citep{budzianowski2018multiwoz}. 
In addition to the datasets mentioned in Background Section~\ref{sec:dialog}, there are several dialogue datasets that specialize in a single domain. ATIS \citep{hemphill1990atis} comprises speech data about airlines structured around formal airline flight tables.  Similarly, the Google Airlines dataset purportedly contains 400,000 templated dialogues about airline reservations \citep{wei2018airdialogue}.\footnote{The Google Airlines dataset has not been released to date.}   %The Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus has over a million dialogues about Ubuntu technical support \citep{lowe2015ubuntu}.  %, and does more quality control than the latter of the two since we are intentionally eliciting this data, and not scraping existing data sources.  

On the other hand, Chit-chat style dialogues without goals have been popular since ELIZA and have been investigated with neural techniques \citep{weizenbaum1966eliza, li2016deep, li2017adversarial}.

However, these datasets cannot be used for modeling goal-oriented tasks.

Related dialogue dataset collections used for Sequential Question Answering rely on dialogue to answer questions, but the task is notably different from our use case of modeling goal oriented conversational AI, hence leading to different evaluation considerations \citep{choi2018quac,reddy2019coqa}.
