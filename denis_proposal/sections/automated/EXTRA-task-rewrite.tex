\section{Defining Question-In-Context Rewrites  \label{sec:pp_task}}

%\todo{example in a figure .. in intro}

%In this section, we define the task of question-in-context rewriting.
%\jbgcomment{Connect this with whatever example you're using}

%We formally define our task for describing our experiments in Section~\ref{sec:expr}.  
%
We formally define the task of question-in-context rewriting
(de-contextualization).
%
Given a conversation topic $t$ and a history $H$ of $m-1$ turns, 
each turn $k$ is a question $q_i$ and an answer $a_i$;
the task is to generate a rewrite $q'_m$ for the next question $q_m$
based on $H$.
%
Since $q_m$ is part of the conversation, its meaning often involves
references to parts of its preceding history.
%
A valid rewrite $q'_m$ should be self-contained: a correct answer
to $q'_m$ by itself is a correct answer to $q_m$ combined with the
question's preceding history $H$.

Figure~\ref{fig:example_convo} shows the assumptions of \abr{cqa} and
how they are made explicit in rewrites.
%
The first question omits the title of the page (Anna Vissi), the
second question omits the answer to the first question (replacing both
Anna Vissi and her husband with the pronoun ``they''), and the last
question adds a scalar implicature that must be resolved.

%% The example in  shows three instances
%% of the rewriting task, one for each question. For example, Question 2 in 
%% our formulation would be: $q_m$ is \textit{``did they have any children?''},
%% $H$ is [\textit{``Anna Vissi'', ``1983-1989: Collaboration with Nikos Karvelas'', ``what happened in 1983?'', "In May 1983, she married Nikos Karvelas, a composer"}]
%% and  the output $q'_m$ is \textit{``did Anna Vissi and Nikos Karvelas have any children together?''}.

%% To compare the outputs of different models for task, we compute the
%% \textsc{bleu} score~\cite{papineni2002bleu} between the hypothesis rewrites
%% produced by different models and the respective human-authored reference rewrites.
